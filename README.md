* **Data Integrity Testing:** Conducted end-to-end data integrity tests by verifying all CRUD operations with the Firebase Firestore backend to prevent any data loss.
* **API Testing:** Used Postman to manually test the API calls made to the Firebase backend, verifying that the correct data was being sent and received between the front-end and the database.
* **Security Testing:** Ensured the Google Sign-In functionality was secure and reliable through rigorous testing of the authentication workflow.
